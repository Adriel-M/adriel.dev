The source code of this blog can be found [here](https://github.com/adriel-m/adriel.dev).

The web stack of this site is:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): React framework to do server side rendering.
- [Tailwind Next.js Start Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog): Theme for Next.js. Includes tailwind css.
- [Tina](https://tina.io/): CMS for creating and updating posts. Also using its free cloud offering.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com): Next.js hosting platform. Deals with deployment and CDN.

I wanted a free and simple website so I decided to use Next.js and Vercel. Originally the stack was Hugo + Github pages but I wanted to embed JSX into my posts so I went with something that supported MDX. Personally, I don’t like editing raw markdown files so I decided to use TinaCMS. It is quite barebones and I’m more used to a richer text editor like notion (maybe the next version of this blog will be backed by notion somehow?).
